```

# 1 - Prepare the data

## 1.1 - Import the files created by my cleaning scripts

```{r}
candy_2015_clean <-
  read_csv(here("03_clean_data/candy_2015_clean.csv"))

candy_2016_clean <-
  read_csv(here("03_clean_data/candy_2016_clean.csv"))

candy_2017_clean <-
  read_csv(here("03_clean_data/candy_2017_clean.csv"))
```


## 1.2 - Create new versions which only contain the columns I'm interested in
```{r}
candy_2015_clean <-
  candy_2015_clean %>% 
  select(year,
         unique_id,
         age,
         gender,
         country,
         going_trick_or_treating,
         candy_name,
         rating)

candy_2016_clean <-
  candy_2016_clean %>% 
  select(year,
         unique_id,
         age,
         gender,
         country,
         going_trick_or_treating,
         candy_name,
         rating)

candy_2017_clean <-
  candy_2017_clean %>% 
  select(year,
         unique_id,
         age,
         gender,
         country,
         going_trick_or_treating,
         candy_name,
         rating)
```

## 1.3 - Put these together into a single table
```{r}
candy_all_years <-
bind_rows(candy_2015_clean, candy_2016_clean, candy_2017_clean)
```

## 1.4 - Check the rows for each year match the individual yearly tables in the environment
```{r}
candy_all_years %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(count= format(n(), big.mark= ","))
```

## 1.5 - Drop the separate yearly tables
```{r}
rm(candy_2015_clean, candy_2016_clean, candy_2017_clean)
```



# 2 - Analysis questions set by CodeClan

## 2.1 - What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (number of candy ratings, not number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

I've already dropped NA ratings in  my cleaning process after the pivot_longer stage
```{r}
candy_all_years %>%
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>%
  summarise(total_number_ratings = format(n(), big.mark= ","))
  
```

## 2.2 - What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating and the average age of people not going trick or treating?

I'm not sure if I need to do something about "NA" in the age field here
```{r}
candy_all_years %>% 
  filter(!is.na(going_trick_or_treating)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(age)) %>%
  group_by(going_trick_or_treating) %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = round(mean(age), 1))
```

## 2.3 - For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?


```{r}

  candy_all_years %>%
  group_by(rating, candy_name) %>%
  summarise(total_ratings = n()) %>% 
  slice_max(total_ratings) %>% 
  rename("item_with_most_ratings" = "candy_name")
  
  
```


## 2.4  - How many people rated Starburst as despair?

I'm using a unique_id I created in the cleaning process to define  a person - it's a combination of various fields in the raw data.

I don't think I really need to do this - any one person can only have one row for their views on Starburst.

This is one I'd like to come back to with a neater bit of code. Though I'm quite fond of the table name **starburst_despair_people**!
```{r}
# check if there are different variations of "Starburst" in the data:
candy_all_years %>%
  filter(str_detect(candy_name, "[sS][tT][aA][rR]")) %>% 
  group_by(candy_name) %>% 
  summarise(number_people_rated_as_despair = n())
```


```{r}
# group at person level using unique_id:
starburst_despair_people <-  
candy_all_years %>% 
  filter(candy_name == "Starburst") %>% 
  filter(rating == "DESPAIR") %>%
  select(unique_id, candy_name, rating) %>% 
  group_by(unique_id, candy_name, rating) %>% 
  arrange(unique_id)
 
# response to question: 
 starburst_despair_people %>%
   group_by(candy_name, rating) %>% 
   summarise(number_of_people = n())
 
  
```


# For the next three questions, count despair as -1, joy as +1 and meh as 0
I'm adding a column for this:
```{r}
candy_all_years <-
  candy_all_years %>%
  select(year:rating) %>% 
         mutate(rating_numeric = case_when(
                            rating ==  "DESPAIR" ~ -1,
                            rating ==  "JOY" ~ 1,
                            rating ==  "MEH" ~ 0,
                            TRUE             ~ NA_real_
                            
  )
  )
```

## 2.5 - What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset?



Note that the 2015 raw data file did not have a gender variable.

```{r}
candy_all_years %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>% 
  group_by(gender, candy_name) %>% 
  summarise(popularity_value = sum(rating_numeric)) %>% 
  slice_max(popularity_value) %>% 
  rename("most_popular_item" = "candy_name")
  
```

## 2.6 - What was the most popular candy bar in each year?

```{r}
candy_all_years %>%
  group_by(year, candy_name) %>% 
  summarise(popularity_value = sum(rating_numeric)) %>% 
  slice_max(popularity_value) %>% 
  rename("most_popular_item" = "candy_name")
```


## 2.7 - What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK and all other countries?

```{r}
candy_all_years %>% 
  group_by(country_summary = case_when(
                                      country == "USA" ~ "1. USA",
                                      country == "Canada" ~ "2. Canada",
                                      country == "UK" ~ "3. UK",
                                      TRUE ~  "4. All other countries"
                                      ),
          candy_name) %>% 
  summarise(popularity_value = sum(rating_numeric)) %>% 
  slice_max(popularity_value) %>% 
  arrange(country_summary) %>% 
  rename("most_popular_item" = "candy_name")
```
