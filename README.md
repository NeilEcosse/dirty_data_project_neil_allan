# CodeClan data analysis course week 4 - dirty data project

## Part 1

We were given the choice of three files to work on - I chose one containing seabird observation data.

This can be found in the folder **task3**



## Part 2

We were all asked to look at some **halloween candy data** - this was designed to be a trickier task, with three tables of particularly messy data.

This can be found in the folder **task4**


## Further information

There is a further **README** file inside each subfolder with full details of the task.
